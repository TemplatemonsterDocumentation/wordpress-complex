<article><h2>Select</h2>

<p>This filter type allows adding a select dropdown filter where the visitor will be able to select from the set values. </p>
<p>You’ll have to specify from where to pull the values using the Data Source option.</p>

<ul class="marked-list">
<li><p><b>Data Source</b> - specify the source from which the select values are to be taken. There are several of them:

<ul class="marked-list">
<li><p><b>Manual input </b> - select this type in case you need to manually fill in the options list with the needed values and add the value labels to show (e.g., you’ve got the custom-made products post type and have the “color” meta field with the slug you’ve filled in. You need to add the values (the actual color values you’ve got in this meta field for the different products) to create the select items allowing to select the products by color.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Posts</b> - select this source to display the post titles as the select items to filter the related posts (e.g., you’ve got the “Speakers” post type and the “Events” post type listing grid. You can select the Posts > Speakers to filter the posts of Event type by speakers participating.</p></li>
<li><p>The Placeholder option allows setting the placeholder text instead of the default one.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Taxonomies</b> - select this source to use the term titles as the labels of the select filter. E.g., you’ve got the “Clothes” post type and “Colors” taxonomy (the terms are the colors, and each Clothing post item is assigned to different terms (depending on the colors). This filter allows displaying the terms and filtering the posts using them. </p></li>
<li><p>Enable Show only children of current term option to allow displaying the child terms in the hierarchy for the parent term (inline, or using any other style).
Enable Group terms by parents option to allow showcasing the child terms below the parent terms.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Custom Fields</b> - in case you’ve got the repeaters in the custom post types, you can specify the Custom Fields data source and the specific Custom Field Key which will display the values from the repeating posts fields. </p></li>

<li><p><b>Placeholder</b> - here you can specify the text to show instead of the standard one shown in the Select filter.</p></li></ul></p></li></ul>
