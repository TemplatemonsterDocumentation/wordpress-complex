<p><li>To sort the popup presets you can use the categories (e.g., check <b>Subscribe</b> category to select the preset from the list of pre-designed presets available, that are related to the <b>Subscribe</b> topic.)</li></p>

<p><li>Also, you can filter the popups by date, popularity, etc. Also, you can view the category of each popup preset and the times this popup was installed and used, under each of the presets. </li></p>

<p><li>To apply one of the presets and start creating your new popup click <b>+Create</b> button.</li></p>

<p><li>After you've clicked <b>+Create</b> button you'll see the popup window where you'll have to confirm your intention to use the preset for creating a new popup template. Click <b>Yes</b> to proceed to creating a new popup template based on the preset you've chosen.</li></p>
