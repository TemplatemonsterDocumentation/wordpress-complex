<h3>Sorting Search Results by Relevance</h3>

<h5>From this block you can learn how to manage the search results in order for the publications to be displayed by relevance. </h5>

<ul class="index-list">

<li><p>Let’s make sure the posts you want to display first contain the needed keywords. Actually, you should set the order of the posts that are to be displayed in the search results, using the density of the keywords. This is needed to preserve the relevancy logics. </p>

<p>To display the result as the first one, and thus more relevant and important, ensure that it has the needed keyword in its title, content and excerpt.</p>
<p>To display the result as a close second to the most relevant one set the keyword in its content and excerpt.</p>

<p>The less important results should contain the keywords as well. The importance of the results decreases as the keywords are set only in content, in excerpt, or in title only.</p></li>

<li><p>Now set the search widget to showcase the search results by relevance. To accomplish this open the page where you want to add the search form with Elementor page builder. After that, find <b>Ajax Search</b> widget and drop it to the page’s canvas.</p></li>

<li><p>Open <b>Content > Search Settings</b> block and select <b>Relevance</b> option from <b>Sort Results by</b> dropdown list.</p></li>
<li><p>Filter search results either by descending or ascending order in the <b>Filter Results by</b> dropdown.</p>
