	<p><li>Switch to <b>Advanced</b> settings and here open <b>JetPopup</b> block. Select the popup template you want to attach to the widget in the <b>Attached Popup</b> dropdown.</li></p>

	<li><p>You can select what will be the trigger for the popup in the <b>Trigger Type</b> dropdown. There are several trigger types available:

		<ul class="marked-list">
			<li><b>Click Button</b> - select this option in order to make the popup window appear when you click the button in the specific widget (e.g., the button in the Animated Box's back side, etc).</li>
			<li><b>Click Selector</b> - here you can enable the popup window when the visitor clicks on the specific element on your site that has the specified CSS selector. After you've selected this option you'll have to input the selector (e.g., .my-selector) in the corresponding field to attach the popup to it.


				<p>Please, note, that in case you've decided to use <b>Click Selector</b> trigger type, you'll have to input the selector from the widget to which you're adding the popup on click.</p>

<p>Hit F12 button to inspect the page and copy the selector inside the widget, which you're planning to use. Then paste the selector in the <b>Custom Selector</b> field (e.g., <b>.element-icon</b>). Make sure you've added a dot before the selector name to mark it as a selector.</p>

			</li></p>
			<li><b>Hover</b> - when you choose this option the popup will appear whenever the visitor hovers to the widget.</li>
			<li><b>Scroll to</b> - the popup will appear when one scrolls the page to the place where the widget is located.</li></ul>
		</p></li>
