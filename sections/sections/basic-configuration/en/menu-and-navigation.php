<h3>Main menu configuration</h3>

<p>Navigate to <strong>Dashboard > Appearance > Menus</strong> in order to create the menu. Next please follow "create a new menu" link, type Menu Name and save settings by pressing the <strong>"Save Menu"</strong> button. Then you're ready to start adding menu items, by default you can add pages, posts, categories, formats, or custom links.</p>

<p>
	After adding menu items and saving the menu you should define its position on the website. You can do that at the <strong> "Manage Locations"</strong> tab or right below the menu, in the <strong>Menu settings</strong> section. Your template includes a few sections (locations) to place your menu. It can be also displayed on the website using widgets.
</p>

	<ul class="marked-list">
		<li>
			Top
		</li>
		<li>
			Main
		</li>	
		<li>
			Social
		</li>
		<li>
			Footer
		</li>
	</ul>

<p>Then you can define the menu position and check the result with the help of the customizer tool.</p>

<p>
	In order to show the list of social icons you need to create a separate menu with <strong>"Social Menu"</strong> title. Then please create menu items for the required social networks, and place this menu at the similar "Social" section. Social icons will be automatically applied. In order to change them to custom ones, you just need to replace the images with the same filenames and save changes. These icons will be also used in the <strong>"Follow"</strong> block.
