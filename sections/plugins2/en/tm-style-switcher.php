<h5>Features and settings</h5>



<p>
	TM Style Switcher operates with settings of WordPress Live Customizer, that’s why it is compatible with just any contemporary theme.
</p>

<p>
	To start working with the plugin go to the Live Customizer in the admin panel of your WordPress website and find the Export/Import tab. Here you will find the following options:
	<ol class="index-list">
	<li><p> Export – generates and downloads a .JSON file with your current theme settings;</p></li>
	<li><p> Import – uploads previously saved theme settings;</p></li>
	<li><p> Restore Settings – restores the default settings that were active before the installation of the plugin.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>
