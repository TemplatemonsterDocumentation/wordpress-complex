<h2>Customizer</h2>
<h5>
	Customizer is a WYSIWYG theme settings interface. You can setup typography, navigation, widgets positioning, background images and colors settings here. Our theme installation will provide you with a wider range of settings, such as social networks configuration, page layouts setting, sidebars, block setting and much more. The main advantage is that you can see the result immediately, and you can change it in no time flat without having to work with the files or code.
