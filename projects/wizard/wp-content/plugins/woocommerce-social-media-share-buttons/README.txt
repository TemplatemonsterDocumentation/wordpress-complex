== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Have questions about Woocommerce Social Media Share Buttons Plugin?
=

 Send us an email to toastiestudio@gmail.com and we will try to answer them.

= Will you be adding Instragram to the plugin?
= I will not be adding a Instragram share button to the plugin. Instagram does not actually support image sharing the same as facebook, pinterest etc. do.
The only way to post a picture to Instagram is by uploading it yourself as Instagram specifically don't want users posting/sharing other peoples photos on its platform.

= Products do not share correctly to Facebook
= Facebook is a picky social media for sharing and looks for open graph meta tags in your sites code. This plugin includes an option to automatically add these tags, so if you are having trouble with facebook share, turn this on.
However if you have another SEO plugin installed, I recommend leaving them off, else you may have duplicate meta tags.
You can trouble shoot facebook share using their debug tool: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
