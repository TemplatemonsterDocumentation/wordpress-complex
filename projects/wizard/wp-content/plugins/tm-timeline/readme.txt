== Configuration ==

= Events =
The timeline consists of events, to which you can assign dates and tags. To create an event, go to "TM Timeline" -> "Add New". Enter the title of your event, and description. In the sidebar specify a date when the event occurred.

= Tags =
If you want to have multiple timelines, you can group your events by assigning tags to them. If you assign more than one tag to an event, you can display it in multiple timelines.

= Settings =
Once you've created your events, you have to configure their display settings. We have several options here:

* Layout - layout represents the way your timeline will be displayed on the page. There are three layout variations: horizontal, vertical, and vertical (chess order).
* Visible items limit - this setting applies to horizontal layout only. You can set the number of events that can be displayed per view. In order to access the events hidden from the view, you have to use navigation arrows.
* Date format - choose from 8 different date formats to display the date in your timeline.
* Tag - select which event group to display based on their tags. If no tag is specified, the timeline will contain all events available.
* Display anchors - if this box is checked, your events will be linking to corresponding event posts, so that your visitors can read about each event in detail.

In order to create a timeline follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the "TM Timeline" -> "Add New" page
2. Create event posts, specify the "Timeline Date" option in each one
3. Create a tag and asign it to the event posts. List of all event posts available on "TM Timeline" -> "Posts" page
4. Navigate to the "TM Timeline" -> "Settings" page, fill in required options and press the "Generate Shortcode" button
5. Simply copy the generated shortcode to your page or post
